For several years I have worked and expanded my knowledge in the field of 3D modeling, with all that it entails:

>  - Modeling
>  - UVs
>  - Texturing
>  - Animation
>  - Lighting
>  - Rendering
>  - Game Engines

Now I've made the leap to web application programming and design:

>  - HTML
>  - CSS
>  - JS
>  - API REST
>  - Node.JS
>  - Socket.IO
>  - MySQL
>  - MongoDB

and I'm still developing in that sector.
